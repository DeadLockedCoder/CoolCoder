        <p><i>BTW I didn't draw the art above, I just found it somewhere on Google.</i></p>
        <p>If you or someone you know made it, feel free to reach out so they can be credited.</p>
        <p><i>Unfortunately</i>, the song I was <b>going</b> to use isn't working for some reason.</p>

        <p>Just my luck, I guess. Everything I came across online either didn't work or only worked upon launching the site for the first time.</p>

        <p>Took me a bit longer than I'd hoped it to but I guess it's a lot more personalized now.</p>
        <p>I'll link the video of the song I was going to use for the background music below:</p>
