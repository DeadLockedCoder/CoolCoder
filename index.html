        <p><i>BTW I didn't draw the art above, I just found it somewhere on Google.</i></p>
        <p>If you or someone you know made it, feel free to reach out so they can be credited.</p>
        <p><i>This song on the other hand</i>, is called <b>"Tom Tom"</b> and is made by a band called Holy F-word that I dare not say.</p>

        <p>Took me a bit longer than I'd hoped it to but I guess it's a lot more personalized now.</p>
        <p>Now that I think about it, I'll link the video that the background music came from below:</p>
